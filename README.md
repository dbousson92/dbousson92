To be blunt and honest I have no interest in coding or intention to continue beyond this course required for my major. This profile is for a class assignment, it will likely be deleted after completion. I am a mechanical engineering student and this was a transfer requirement for U of M. 

With that said I did ok im my python course. I do not recall much as it has been almost a full year since I have finished the course. I have not written so much as a "Hello World" since finsihing last December. I expect this course on C++ to be significantly harder as my understanding is that python is one of the easier languages.

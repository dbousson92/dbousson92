I am a mechanical engineering student and this C++ course is a transfer requirement for U of M. To be completly honest coding has been my least favorite coursework so far. I am more of a math, chem, and physics person than a logical structure person. 

With that said I did ok im my python course. I do not recall much as it has been almost a full year since I have finished the course. I have not written so much as a "Hello World" since finishing December 2020. I expect this course on C++ to be significantly harder as my understanding is that python is one of the easier languages. I would have liked to take this class sequentially but I prioritized the other parts of the transfer requirements, online classes were too difficult for me to continue taking 16 credits per semester.

I have started by uploading the most advanced code I have saved from my previous course and the most advanced code I still understand. "Lab 4" is a simple choice struture of rock paper scissors. The computer has a randomized responce and then an iff declares win, lose, or draw. The game continues to run in a while loop until the user selects not to play again. "Lab" appears to collect information, store it on a list, and something about classes. I really feel lost reading through the actual code of "lab 8"

The most recent file is assignment_2. This is a program that shows the use of manipulators and mathmatical operations. This also shows string converstion as well as casting. The program takes and input and uses global variables to show shipping needs, shipping costs, and profit.

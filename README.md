I am a mechanical engineering student and this C++ course is a transfer requirement for U of M. To be completly honest coding has been my least favorite coursework so far. I am more of a math, chem, and physics person than a logical structure person. 

With that said I did ok im my python course. I do not recall much as it has been almost a full year since I have finished the course. I have not written so much as a "Hello World" since finishing December 2020. I expect this course on C++ to be significantly harder as my understanding is that python is one of the easier languages. I would have liked to take this class sequentially but I prioritized the other parts of the transfer requirements, online classes were too difficult for me to continue taking 16 credits per semester.

I have started by uploading the most advanced code I have saved from my previous course and the most advanced code I still understand. "Lab 4" is a simple choice struture of rock paper scissors. The computer has a randomized responce and then an iff declares win, lose, or draw. The game continues to run in a while loop until the user selects not to play again. "Lab" appears to collect information, store it on a list, and something about classes. I really feel lost reading through the actual code of "lab 8"

The most recent file is assignment_2. This is a program that shows the use of manipulators and mathmatical operations. This also shows string converstion as well as casting. The program takes and input and uses global variables to show shipping needs, shipping costs, and profit.

Assignment_3 was just added as this weeks task in my C++ class. This is a program to calculate shipping costs but for us was am introduction to branching and operators. This week we also were introduced to the idea of magic numbers and why it is important to avoid them. This program does not have any in the calculations and the only time numbers randomly appeared they are commented in that they correlate to an ASCII.

Assignment_4 is my first experience using a command line to pass anything. This program will accept an arugment and analyze it. It is limited with a hard code to just analyze one passed object per run. The program will count vowels and total those up. It also counts three random letters, I chose x, y, and z. This also features a rather large switch statement to filter through and count. This was my first experience using a switch statement instead of some form of an if branch.

Assignment 5 is an attempt at creating user defined functions. This program is using the DRY principle. A menu is created in a loop and each selection calls a function. You can create a shopping cart of surfboards and see a total before exiting. There is also a user instruction to explain the surfboard price and size as well as the basics of how to operate the program. This program passes in varibales and manipulates them inside the user functions.

Assignment 6 is the first time using arrays in c++. There are still all other previous practices involved, such as user defined functions. The main function here is simply a couple declared variables and then the functions called. This function takes a consistent text file and splits names from scores. We used bowling scores but realistically a teacher could use this to input grades and get an average score too.
